## Frontier Experiment Proposals
The following WAMECU-aligned experiments push into adjacent disciplines where bias manifolds manifest in unconventional substrates. Each concept includes its motivation, testing pathway, and the visualization we would surface in a companion notebook.

### 1. Quantum Lattice Drift Observatory (Physics)
- **Why it matters:** Quantum annealers and lattice simulations routinely exhibit hardware-specific drift. Mapping WAMECU’s Mechanics and Correlated Drift terms onto qubit energy landscapes would reveal whether β captures decoherence-induced biases that classical models miss.
- **How to test it:** Simulate annealing sweeps using `wamecu.simulation` seeded with synthetic Hamiltonians whose couplings slowly deform. Couple the simulator to `wamecu.estimation` to perform adaptive β tracking per qubit cluster, then challenge the estimator with injected stochastic resets mimicking cryogenic calibration cycles.
- **Notebook visual:** A time-lattice heatmap showing β trajectories per qubit cluster across anneals, with overlays marking calibration pulses—highlighting regions where WAMECU anticipates drift before observable energy spikes.

### 2. Cryptographic Entropy Leak Cartography (Cryptography)
- **Why it matters:** Modern pseudo-random generators can leak subtle biases through hardware entropy pools. Translating WAMECU’s Entropy deviations and Unknowns into entropy-score diagnostics could flag cryptographic RNG degradation before catastrophic failures.
- **How to test it:** Generate bitstreams from multiple RNG profiles (ideal, biased, side-channel compromised) and feed them into `wamecu.anomaly.score_bias_anomalies`. Train β estimators on rolling windows to detect shifts, and evaluate detection lead time against NIST SP 800-22 metrics as a baseline.
- **Notebook visual:** A comparative ribbon chart aligning β anomaly scores with conventional randomness test p-values, emphasizing intervals where WAMECU signals a leak while standard batteries still pass.

### 3. Computational Complexity Phase Transition Atlas (Complexity Theory)
- **Why it matters:** Satisfiability instances exhibit sharp phase transitions where solution probability collapses. Embedding WAMECU into this landscape can quantify how Weight and Atmosphere terms explain the emergent bias in solver success across constraint densities.
- **How to test it:** Use `wamecu.pipeline.run_wamecu_cycle` to orchestrate synthetic SAT instance generation, solver simulation, and β estimation across varying clause-to-variable ratios. Introduce adaptive feedback that perturbs instance generation based on prior β gradients to probe edge cases near the phase boundary.
- **Notebook visual:** A β phase diagram plotting clause density vs. estimated β, annotated with solver success rates, illustrating how WAMECU pinpoints the critical transition region more sharply than raw success counts.

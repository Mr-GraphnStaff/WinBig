    "# WAMECU Bias Simulation Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a minimal simulation environment for exploring the WAMECU framework — an AI-assisted approach to quantifying bias in systems that are often treated as random. The notebook generates synthetic draws under controlled bias coefficients, illustrates how the WAMECU adjustment modifies baseline probabilities, and offers simple diagnostics for detecting and estimating bias."

    "\n",
    "The helper functions below implement the core WAMECU relationship. The `wamecu_probabilities` function converts a vector of bias coefficients into a probability distribution. Bias coefficients are expected to average to zero; however, the helper function defensively normalizes the distribution to account for rounding or exploratory inputs. The `simulate_draws` utility produces synthetic outcome data so the rest of the notebook can focus on analysis."
